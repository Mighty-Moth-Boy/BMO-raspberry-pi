# Real-Life BMO with Raspberry Pi

Inspired by a creative TikTok showcasing a real-life BMO, this project was my journey into bringing Adventure Time's BMO into the tangible world. When a friend gifted me a Raspberry Pi and a 3D printer, the idea of recreating BMO became irresistible. What started as an inspiration transformed into a month-long passion project, involving meticulous 3D printing, hardware interfacing, and software development.

This was forked from [IamMrUnicorn/BMO-Raspberry-Pi](https://github.com/IamMrUnicorn/BMO-raspberry-pi) ,by the way.
## üé® Features:

### **3D Printed Model**
- Leveraging custom-tweaked design files, BMO was brought to life with nearly a week of dedicated 3D printing.

### **Hardware Interfacing**
- Buttons connected directly to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins enable users to engage with BMO seamlessly.

### **Voice Command Detection**
- A dynamic Python script constantly listens for voice commands, triggering responses or actions based on its internal intelligent phrase matching system.

### **Advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
- Incorporated [Eleven Labs](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis)' AI for the initial TTS conversion.
- The output undergoes further refinement through a custom-trained BMO voice model, thanks to [mangio-RVC](https://github.com/Mangio621/Mangio-RVC-Fork).

## üåü Future Plans:
- **Virtual Assistant Capabilities**: BMO's skill set is set to grow! Aiming to incorporate Chat GPT for internet search capabilities to rival virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.
- **Gaming Fun**: Plans to bring in Retro Pi are underway, enabling BMO to emulate classic games for hours of nostalgic entertainment.

## üôè Acknowledgements:
- Immense gratitude to the original TikTok creator for sparking the idea and providing the foundational design.
- Shoutout to [Eleven Labs](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis) and [mangio-RVC](https://github.com/Mangio621/Mangio-RVC-Fork) for their exceptional tools that added layers of authenticity to the project.

## ü§ù Contributing:
Though a personal passion project, I'm open to suggestions and contributions! If you have ideas or spot any bugs:
- Fork the repository and submit a pull request.
- Alternatively, feel free to open an issue. Let's make BMO better, together!
